  target_hypercube,
  sample_hypercube,
  varlist = "all",
  method = "regular",
  type = "subsample",
  bins = 10,
  minbin = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{target_hypercube}{is folder location where all predictors are stored; for type space-time = raster for future climates of AOI}

\item{sample_hypercube}{for subsample a file of points; for space-space and space-time a rastfolder location with comparative rasters}

\item{varlist}{list of variables to include in hypercube}

\item{method}{either "regular" for systematic sampling or "random"}

\item{type}{either "subsample", "space-space", "space-time"}

\item{bins}{number of bins to create for each raster layer}

\item{graph_compare}{TRUE/FALSE to generate a ggplot comparing target and sample distibutions for each variable}

\item{return_spatial}{TRUE/FALSE to generate of 2 layers ina geopackage showing where there is missing space in the target AOI and source areas from the sample}

\item{sample_type}{either "number", "density'}

\item{size}{the number of samples to generate or the density of points in kilometers}

\item{min_bin}{the minimum number of points in a bin to be considered adequately sampled}
}
\description{
Compares the hypercube dimensions of two data sets for either:
\enumerate{
\item a space-space comparison where target is an area-of-interest (AOI) and sample is a subsample taken from the same area; or
\item a space-time comparison where target is a future climate for an AOI and sample is an area of historic source climates
Creates a hypercube label for each point from bin numbers for each raster
