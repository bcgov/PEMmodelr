\item{cutoff}{set the correlation threshold for removal}

\item{corr_plot}{output a correlation plot}

\description{
Runs a correlation on subsample of points taken from the subsample_map_raster function and runs a correlation analysis
and saves a feature list that is used to reduce the set of variables in the machine learning model.
